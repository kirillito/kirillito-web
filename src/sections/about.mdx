When I wrote my first program back in 2000, I had no idea that software development would become my career and a life-long passion. While working on my masters degree in Computer Science at the university, I developed a great deal of affection for design patterns and algorithms. Finding beautiful programming solutions to complex problems is still one of my favorite parts of this job, and even now, years after finishing my degree and parting ways with competitive programming, I try to find time to solve some problems from ProjectEuler or LeetCode.

Over the last years I've had a chance to work with multiple technologies in a variety of different industries. The chance to constantly learn something new and evolve my skills is another thing that I like about being a developer. I believe that a good developer can learn any framework or new language, and that common sense, personal character qualities and foundations like design patterns, algorithms, "clean code" principles are much more important in this industry.

In recent years, my learning interests are expanding outside of technology fields as I embrace more senior responsibilities like mentoring and team building. Improving my soft skills, while keeping up with ever-changing technology market is my ongoing goal. 

Besides my full stack developer responsibilities, I currently act as a Scrum Master for my team. While it's important for me to stay on developer/architect career path, purely coding intermediate roles are of no interest to me at the moment.
