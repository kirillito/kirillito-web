  Chat bot I'm writing for my team Slack channel.<br />
  I was curious about learning Go language, so after doing a few tutorials, I've decided to jump right into the code and write something useful and fun. 
  This project is still very young, but I plan to improve it and branch it off into more bots with NLP support using Prose Go library.<br /><br />
  Tech stack: Go language, BoltDB NoSQL DB, <br/>Slack Real Time Messaging API<br /><br />

  Website for Liga Yoga Brasil group.<br />
  While working on my portfolio website I fell in love with React.js. Instead of continuing learning it with tutorials, I've decided to start a big complex project in React/Redux and get my experience there. Eventially this portal will be moved to AWS with video streaming and MongoDB support for non-transational logic.<br /><br />
  Tech stack: React.js<br /><br />
